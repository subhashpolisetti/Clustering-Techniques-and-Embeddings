## 1. K-Means Clustering from Scratch
This notebook implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch, covering the steps of centroid initialization, iterative cluster assignment, and centroid updates. It includes visualizations and evaluation metrics such as inertia to assess clustering performance.

---

## 2. Hierarchical Clustering
This notebook demonstrates hierarchical clustering using Python libraries. It includes visualizations of cluster merging through dendrograms and explanations on how to interpret hierarchical trees for clustering.

---

## 3. Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering
This notebook showcases Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for clustering, explaining the probabilistic approach to cluster assignments. It also evaluates the clustering results using AIC, BIC, and other relevant metrics.

---

## 4. DBSCAN Clustering Using PyCaret
In this notebook, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is implemented using PyCaret. This density-based approach identifies clusters with varying shapes and detects noise. The notebook includes clustering quality evaluations using silhouette scores.

---

## 5. Anomaly Detection Using PyOD
This notebook demonstrates how to apply anomaly detection using the PyOD library, handling both univariate and multivariate datasets. Anomalies in time series data are detected and visualized to aid interpretation.

---

## 6. Clustering Time Series Data Using Pretrained Models
This notebook focuses on clustering time series data using pretrained models, including techniques such as stock market analysis. It compares methods like TS-PTMs and LLM embeddings for clustering temporal patterns.

---

## 7. Document Clustering with LLM Embeddings
This notebook demonstrates clustering documents using advanced embeddings, such as those from Sentence Transformers. It employs semantic similarity for clustering and evaluates the results using silhouette scores.

---

## 8. Image Clustering Using ImageBind LLM Embeddings
In this notebook, image clustering is performed using embeddings from Meta's ImageBind model. It also explores the use of cross-modality embeddings, clustering images alongside other modalities, with visualizations such as t-SNE.

---

## 9. Audio Clustering Using ImageBind LLM Embeddings
This notebook focuses on clustering audio files using embeddings from ImageBind. It applies K-Means clustering and visualizes the results with t-SNE and waveform plots.

---

## Common Evaluation Metrics
- **Inertia and Silhouette Scores**: Used to evaluate clustering performance.
- **Visualization Techniques**: t-SNE, PCA, dendrograms, and heatmaps help in interpreting the clustering results.
- **Probabilistic Measures**: These are used in GMMs and anomaly detection to evaluate the likelihood of clusters and anomalies.
