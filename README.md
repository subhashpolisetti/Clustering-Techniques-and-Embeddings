## Common Evaluation Metrics
- **Inertia and Silhouette Scores**: Used to evaluate clustering performance.
- **Visualization Techniques**: t-SNE, PCA, dendrograms, and heatmaps help in interpreting the clustering results.
- **Probabilistic Measures**: These are used in GMMs and anomaly detection to evaluate the likelihood of clusters and anomalies.
